# Power Automate Desktop

In this directory, you will find Power Automate Desktop snippets. You can easily copy the contents of the *.txt files here and paste it in Power Automate Desktop.

## Version Compatibility
The README.md files under each snippet should outline the version of Power Automate Desktop in which the snippet was created. 
In most cases, Power Automate Desktop snippets are compatible with the same version and later versions of the application. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

In case you are trying to paste a snippet that is made with a later version of Power Automate Desktop than yours, your options are:

* Update your instance of Power Automate Desktop to the latest version
* Try pasting the actions anyway
* Paste them one by one avoiding those that are not accepted and create the invalid actions manually

If the syntax of a certain action has changed in the later version, pasting the entire code block will be cancelled by the designer and you will not get any actions at all.
To get at least some of them pasted, you can try splitting the block into smaller chunks or pasting the actions one by one, until you hit one that is not accepted.
It is very likely that most actions will still be accepted anyway, especially simple actions, such as **Set variable**, **Run subflow**, etc., while more recent actions or actions with more custom attributes may not be allowed.

Then create the actions that were not accepted manually by following the screenshots, the descriptions or the code that is provided for the snippet.
