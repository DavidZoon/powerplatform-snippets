modelDisplayName: Out of Office set up
modelDescription: |-
  The action is triggered after the action 'Out of Office Creator - prompt sample' generates an Out of Office message text, ready to be used as an automatic reply.
  When triggered, first ask the user if they would like to set the generated message as their automatic reply in Outlook.
  Important: The confirmation question must not include or display the Out of Office message text.
  
  Proceed to set the automatic reply only if the user explicitly confirms.
  
  Notes:
  Do not set up automatic reply before you receive confirmation from the user.
  After the action completes, the agent informs the user that the Out of Office message has been successfully set in Outlook.
